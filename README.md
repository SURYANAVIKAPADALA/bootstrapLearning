Key Components
Responsive Layout with Bootstrap:
Bootstrap automatically ensures that your content adjusts based on the screen size. It helps to create a layout that looks good on devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.

Text Styling:
You can use Bootstrap's predefined classes to style your text with different colors and emphasis. For example, you can apply classes like text-primary, text-danger, or text-success to change the text color to match different meanings (e.g., success, warning, etc.).

Table:
A table is included to display data in a structured format. Bootstrap helps style the table to make it look clean and readable. You can add rows with data like names and destinations.

Carousel:
The project uses a carousel component, which is a type of slideshow. It allows you to display a series of images or content that users can navigate through.

Login Form:
There's also a simple login form that includes fields for entering a username and password. This form uses Bootstrap's form classes to ensure it's neatly styled and functional.

Custom Styling:
While Bootstrap provides many built-in styles, you can also add your own custom CSS file to change the look and feel of the page, such as altering font styles, colors, and layout adjustments.d
